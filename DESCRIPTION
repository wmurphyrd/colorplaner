Title: ggplot2 Extension to Visualize Two Variables per Color Aesthetic Through
    Color Space Projection
Version: 0.0.0.9006
Date: 2016-07-21
Author: William Murphy
Maintainer: William Murphy <william.murphy.rd@gmail.com>
Description: Add additional dimensionality to visualizations by using the color
    and/or fill aesthetics to convey the values of two continuous variables each. By
    projecting variable values onto YUV color space, a scale is created that allows
    viewers to intuitively determine the values of both variables from the single
    displayed color. Includes two new scales and a new guide for ggplot2.
